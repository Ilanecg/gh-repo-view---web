      <p>I am a political philosopher by training. However, currently I am studying a second Master's Degree in Innovation, Strategy and
      Entrepreneurship with the intention to make a career change and join Berlinâ€™s start-up
      ecosystem. In the future, I would like to found a start-up or social agency of my own, where I can combine my political
      science, economics and business expertise with my web development skills.</p>
